## Original contribution

This project is inherited from popular [GarageQTPi project](https://github.com/Jerrkawz/GarageQTPi.git)

## Preface
Majordomo solution is suggested as controller of typical outsige garden door with control unit, which offers open contacts for external controller for opening, stopping and closing gates. Some units offers even step mode, which opens gate for half.
This solution uses 4 hardware relays and independent reed switch, which indicates status closed. You shoud have to instal independet realy switch, do no use built in from gate control unit, due to lost of warranty.
For future functonaly, software reserves independent BUTTON input for Door bel, but this is not currently implemented.

Actualy, software solution uses only two relays - STEP RELAY and STOP RELAY. Check your documentation, how to control your controller with only two commands. 
1. STEP should act as "inverter". When gate is opened, should start closing, when closed, shoud start opening. 2. STOP should immediately stops any action. Usualy acts as inverted contact.

## Hardware

1. Raspberry pi 4
   * [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07TC2BK1X/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_35PGYZTZP17XYZ7DT9EN)
2. 4-Channel 5V Relay board with optocouplers 
   * [Relay board](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07CRRK7R8/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_FN9T62C92G276815FRJ)
3. Magnetic Reed switch
   * [Magnetic Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F5WS5WX/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_X87FGHWG5QX7VVAK05BK)
4. Additional wires/wire nuts. 
    * solid copper wire for garage motor wiring
    * jumper wiries for GPIO pins
5. Mounting Hardware. 
    * For external environment, for best result use at least IP44 box.


## Wiring/Installation

![alt text](Majordomo wiring.pdf)

Reed switch sould be wired directly beteween GPIO17 and GND.
Possible button for door bell beteween GPIO27 and GND.

### Relay wiring
**IMPORTANT: You shoud always consult with a user guide of control unit of gate before wiring relays**

Relays have two type of contacts - Normally Opened (NO) and Normaly Closed (NC). Be sure to wire correct type of output. relays of type OPEN, CLOSE and STEP should by typically NO, **STOP** would be typicaly NC.

The basic idea is to wire it in parallel with the button on the wall.
The code is essentially mimicking a button press by switching the relay on and off quickly. In my case the two leftmost wires (red/white) are connected to the button on the wall.
The two rightmost white wires are for the collision detection sensors. So I removed the two leftmost wires, wirenutted 3 solid 14 gauge wires together (the button wire, my relay wire, and then one wire to go to the garage door opener) two times for each of the two wires.

## Software

### Prereqs 
* Raspberry pi 3 or 4 running rasbian jessie
* Python 2.7.x
* pip3 (python 3 pip)

### Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/Jerrkawz/GarageQTPi.git` to `/home/pi/Development/majordomo` folder
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. edit the `config.yaml` to set up mqtt (See below)
3. run `nohup python3 /home/pi/Development/majordomo/mqtt_gate/main.py &` 
5. Optionaly, add start script: copy and enable `majordomo.service` for `systemctl` daemon

## MQTT setup
I won't try to butcher an mqtt setup guide but will instead link you to some other resources:

HomeAssistant MQTT Setup: https://home-assistant.io/components/mqtt/

Bruh Automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsDHEDbyLfg

## Home Assistant component setup
Either follow the cover setup or enable mqtt discovery  
HomeAssistant MQTT Cover: https://home-assistant.io/components/cover.mqtt/  
HomeAssistant MQTT Discovery: https://home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/

## API Reference

The server works with the Home Assisant MQTT Cover component out of the box but if you want to write your own MQTT client you need to adhere to the following API:

Publish one of the following UPPER CASE strings to the command_topic in your config:

`OPEN | CLOSE | STOP`

Subscribe to the state_topic in your config and you will recieve one of these lower case strings when the state pin changes:

`open | closed`

Thats it!
